              At Beaulah's Bakery, we work with local growers and farmers to
              source all of our fruit, eggs, milk, and butter. Come taste the
              difference that a farm-fresh egg makes in a freshly baked loaf of
              challah bread. Local sourcing isn't just the right thing to do,
              it's the delicious thing to do!

              Beaulah McGillicuddy grew up in a family of bakers. Whether it was
              baking cookies with grandma or a birthday cake with mom for her
              brothers, she was a natural at what she did. She fell in love with
              the craft and started Beaulah's Bakery to showcase her baking
              prowess through decades-old family tradition and a whole lot of
              love.

            <p class="about__paragraph">
              At Beaulah's Bakery, it's important to us that we give back to the
              community that makes us who we are. That's why, for each dollar
              you spend, we donate ten cents to local shelters and youth
              programs. We believe that we are here to serve our community, not
              the other way around.
