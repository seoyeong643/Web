## Step 1: Implementing `chooseRandomGenre()`

This function needs to randomly return either "drama", "fantasy", or "comedy". The general approach should be to generate a random number that is either 0, 1, or 2. Then you can make a code path for each of these three possibilities using a conditional statement. Finally, return a different value in each of the three code paths.

## Step 2: Implementing `displayRandomShow(genre)`

This function does all the heavy lifting for the user experience. Remember, the user selects a genre from the dropdown and then this function runs.

So what do we need this function to do? Dr. Small likes to handle the special case first - that's when the genre parameter is "random" and we want to reassign `genre`. How can we determine that? We can check the genre parameter in a conditional statement (i.e. an if statement) and reassign it in the conditional code block using `chooseRandomGenre()`. We can use triple equal signs to check if the genre is "random".

```js
// Example structure

if (/* code to check if genre is random */) {
  /* code to reassign genre using the chooseRandomGenre() function */
}
```

Once we handle that special case we can keep going knowing that the genre parameter will now be "drama", "fantasy", or "comedy".

Given a genre of either "drama", "fantasy", or "comedy", we now need to display a random show from the corresponding array. One place we can start is by selecting which array we need to return a show from.

We can create 3 different code paths using a conditional statement that compares `genre` to "drama", "fantasy", or "comedy".  We can do this with an `if`/`else if`/`else` statement. Once you write the first two cases, the final `else` can handle "comedy" without the need for comparing anything.

```js
// Example structure

if (/* code to check if genre is drama */) {
  /* code to display a random element from the drama shows array */
} else if (/* code to check if genre is fantasy */) {
  /* code to display a random element from the fantasy shows array */
} else {
  /* code to display a random element from the comedy shows array */
}
```

Now we can look at what to do within each individual path; let's start with the case when `genre` is `"drama"`. We want to select a random element from the `dramaShows` array, and then display it on the page. 
For that, we need a random index that is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (array indices start at 0 and there are 5 elements total). We can generate such a random number by calling `getRandomNumber` and storing the result in a variable like `randomIndex`.  Finally, we can display a show from the `dramaShows` array at that random index by calling the `displayShow(show)` prodivded helper function. The `show` parameter will be the element from the `dramaShows` array at the `randomIndex` you stored earlier.

The remaining 2 code paths can be handled similarly.  There is something interesting to note here. Each array has 5 elements, so we are writing the same code 3 times for generating a random number. Oftentimes we'll see that we are repeating ourselves in code and this should always signal an opportunity to refactor something. In this case, we could generate `randomIndex` once in the beginning of the function and use it in all three code paths.
